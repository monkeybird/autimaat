## autimaat

This program is an IRC bot, specifically written for a private IRC channel.


## Install

    $ go get github.com/monkeybird/autimaat


## Usage

First, create a new profile directory and configuration file:

	$ autimaat -new /path/to/profile

Edit the newly created configuration file to your liking:

	$ nano /path/to/profile/profile.cfg

Relaunch the bot to use the new profile:

	$ autimaat /path/to/profile

In order to have the bot automatically re-launch after shutdown, an external
supervisor like systemd is required. The bot will create a PID file at
`/path/to/profile/app.pid`, in case the supervisor requires it.

The bot will fork itself once, after it has been launched. This is done
to play nice with things like systemd. Manually forking the bot Can be done
through the command:

	$ kill -s USR1 `pidof autimaat`

This tells the bot to fork itself, while passing along any existing
connections. The old process then shuts itself down. This mechanism allows
the bot to be binary-patched, without downtime.


### Weather plugin

The `weather` module provides bindings for weather related APIs.
These services require registration of accounts in order to get needed
API keys.

* https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/

These keys should put in a separate `weather.cfg` file, with the
following contents:

	{
	  "WundergroundApiKey": "xxxxx"
	}


### url plugin

The `url` plugin uses the `YouTube Data API v3` to fetch playback durations
for videos being linked in a channel. This API requires the registration of
a Google Developer API key at: [https://console.developers.google.com/apis](https://console.developers.google.com/apis)

The API key you receive should be assigned to the `YoutubeApiKey` field in
the bot profile.

The key should put in a separate `url.cfg` file, with the following contents:

	{
	  "YoutubeApiKey": "xxxxx"
	}


## Versioning

The bot version is made up of 3 numbers:

* Major version: This number only changes if the bot itself changes in a way
  that makes it incompatible with previous versions. This does not include
  modules implementing commands.
* Minor version: This number changes whenever one of the module APIs change,
  or commands are added/removed.
* Revision: This is the build number. It is a current unix timestamp, which
  is updated whenever the bot is recompiled. This happenes whenever any kind
  of change occurs in any of the code. Including bug fixes. This number is
  updated through a go build flag. E.g.: 

```
go install -ldflags "-X github.com/monkeybird/autimaat/app.VersionRevision=`date -u +%s`"
```



## String translations

The output of the bot to IRC channels/users is done in a specific language (duh).
Translations for all used strings can be found in the various `strings.go` files,
included in all plugins, as well as the `cmd` package. Basically, you should
`find . -name strings.go` to get them all. Then edit them as needed.
